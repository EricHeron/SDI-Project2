<p>I decided to change my story for Project 2. This time I will be telling a story about chores. I will have different characters complete every day house chores. I just hope that my attempt makes sense. I also hope that you enjoy the story.</p>
<p>You may also use this space to explain any elements of your code story that may not be entirely clear.  For example, if your theme is thirteenth century Italian poetry, not everyone may be familiar with that.</p>
<p>Don't forget to replace all of the capitalized elements in this template with your information.  Your term number should be in a <em>yymm</em> format, including the year and the month.</p>
